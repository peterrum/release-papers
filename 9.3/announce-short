Version 9.2.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded
the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at
https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
  - Seven new tutorial programs (steps 47, 50, 58, 65, 67, 69, 70)
    demonstrating solving a variety of equations and illustrating
    functionality in deal.II.
  - Improvements for large parallel computations.
  - Better support for particle methods as well as hp-adaptivity.
  - Better Python interfaces.

The main features of deal.II are:
  - Extensive documentation and 66 working example programs
  - Support for dimension-independent programming
  - Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
  - A zoo of different finite elements
  - Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
    scaling from laptops to clusters with 100,000+ of processor cores
  - Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
