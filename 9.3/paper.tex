\section{Overview}

\dealii{} version 9.2.0 was released May 20, 2020.
This paper provides an
overview of the new features of this release and serves as a citable
reference for the \dealii{} software library version 9.2. \dealii{} is an
object-oriented finite element library used around the world in the
development of finite element solvers. It is available for free under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Downloads are available at
\url{https://www.dealii.org/} and \url{https://github.com/dealii/dealii}.

The major changes of this release are:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item A new, parallel, fully distributed triangulation class (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:pft});
  \item Substantially improved performance for very large computations
    on tens or hundreds of thousands of processor cores and up to
    trillions of unknowns (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:performance});
  \item Better support for parallel $hp$-adaptive algorithms (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:hp});
  \item Support for particle-based methods (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:particles});
  \item Improved performance of the symbolic differentiation framework (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:symbdiff});
  \item Advances in SIMD capabilities and the matrix-free infrastructure (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:mf});
  \item Advances in GPU support (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:gpu});
  \item Better use of modern C++ language features (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:cxx});
  \item Seven new tutorial programs (see
        Section~\ref{subsec:steps}).
\end{itemize}
%
These major changes are discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:major}. There
are a number of other noteworthy changes in the current \dealii{} release
that we briefly outline in the remainder of this section:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item globally unique cell IDs
\end{itemize}

The current release of \dealii adds support for simplex meshes (consisting of triangles in 2D; tetrahedra in 3D) and mixed meshes (consisting of triangles and/or 
quadrilaterals in 2D; tetrahedra, pyramids, wedges, and/or hexahedra in 3D). 
Many freely available mesh-generation tools produce such kind of meshes; while users of \dealii used to have to pre-process such meshes and convert them to pure hex meshes, they
can now directly work with them.

\subsubsection{Refactoring of internal data structures}

To enable simplex and mixed mesh support, we performed a major refactoring of the internal data structures of \dealii. In particular, the \texttt{Triangulation} class and 
the \texttt{DoFHandler} class have undergone large changes. 

The template parameters of the internal data structures of \texttt{Triangulation}
have been removed and the type of each cell and of each face (only in 3D) is stored. The function
\texttt{Triangulation::create\_\allowbreak triangulation()}, which converts a given list of
cells and vertices to the internal data structures, has been rewritten 
inspired by \citep{logg09} and a speed-up of up to 5 has been reached. Minor adjustments 
have been made to \texttt{parallel::shared::Triangulation} and \texttt{parallel::\allowbreak fullydistributed::\allowbreak Triangulation} such that 
the new mesh types can be processed also in parallel.

The internal data structures of \texttt{DoFHandler} used to be hard-coded for pure
hypercube meshes, while the \texttt{hp::DoFHandler} used to be built around
CRS-like data structures. Due to the need of CRS data structures in
\texttt{DoFHandler} in the context of more general meshes, we have merged
\texttt{hp::DoFHandler} into the \texttt{DoFHandler}. The class \texttt{hp::DoFHandler}, which is now a dummy derivation of \texttt{DoFHandler}, currently only exists for compatibility reasons. For
more details see Subsection~\ref{TODO}.

\subsubsection{Generating meshes }

The most obvious way to generate a simplex or a mixed mesh is to read the mesh from a file
generated by an external mesh generator. Currently, we support the 
file formats \texttt{VTK}, \texttt{MSH}, \texttt{EXODUS II}.

Alternatively, one can create a pure hypercube mesh with the known functions
in the \texttt{GridGenerator} namespace and convert the obtained mesh to a
pure simplex mesh with the function 
\texttt{convert\_\allowbreak hypercube\_\allowbreak to\_\allowbreak simplex\_\allowbreak mesh()} from the \texttt{GridGenerator} namespace.

\subsubsection{Simplex mesh}

After having created a triangulation, one can proceed as usual in the case of
a pure simplex mesh by selecting an appropriate finite element, mapping, and
quadrature class:

\begin{c++}
Simplex::FE_P<dim, spacedim> fe(degree);
MappingFE<dim, spacedim> mapping(Simplex::FE_P<dim, spacedim>(1));
Simplex::QGauss<dim> quad(degree + 1);

DoFHandler<dim> dof_handler(tria);
dof_handler.distribute_dofs(fe);

FEValues<dim, spacedim> fe_values(mapping, fe, quad, flags);
\end{c++}
The  list of currently supported finite-element classes is provided in Table~\ref{tab:simplex:fe}. Currently,
only linear iso-parametric mapping (\texttt{MappingFE}) is available, which takes one of the 
finite elements mentioned before. For quadrature, the classes \texttt{QGauss}, 
\texttt{QGaussPyamid}, and \texttt{QGaussWedge} from the \texttt{simplex} namespace are
available.

\subsubsection{Mixed mesh}
For mixed meshes, concepts known from the hp context have been applied: 
 different finite-element classes are assigned to different cell types. In the 
case of a 2D mixed mesh, which can only consists of triangles and
quadrilaterals, the finite element defined on a triangle (e.g., \texttt{Simplex::FE\_P})
and on a quadrilateral (e.g., \texttt{FE\_Q}) can be collected in a \texttt{hp::FECollection}:

\begin{c++}  
hp::FECollection<dim, spacedim> fe
  {Simplex::FE_P<dim, spacedim>(degree), FE_Q<dim, spacedim>(degree)};
\end{c++}

Similarly, \texttt{hp::QCollection} and \texttt{hp::MappingCollection} can be used
to construct appropriate collections. Furthermore, the right active finite-element index, which points to the right 
finite element of that cell, has to be assigned to each cell:

\begin{c++}  
DoFHandler<dim> dof_handler(tria);

for (const auto &cell : dof_handler.active_cell_iterators())
  switch(cell->reference_cell_type())
    {
      case ReferenceCell::Type::Tri:  cell->set_active_fe_index(0); break;
      case ReferenceCell::Type::Quad: cell->set_active_fe_index(1); break;
      // 3D (Tet, Pyramid, Wedge, Hex) not shown
      default: Assert(false, ExcNotImplemented());
    }

dof_handler.distribute_dofs(fe);
\end{c++}

\subsubsection{Practical implications} 

The introduction of simplex and mixed meshes leads to some implications
for the user if these features should be used. For instance, each cell might have a different type with 
different number of vertices, lines, and faces so that these quantities cannot be 
compile-time constants anymore. This information used to be queried from
the \texttt{GeometryInfo} class. To avoid using this class, we have extended
relevant classes, e.g., \texttt{TriaAccessor} or \texttt{TriaCellAccessor},
with useful new functions like \texttt{n\_vertices()}, \texttt{n\_lines()}, or
\texttt{n\_faces()} so that users can simply write:
\begin{c++}
for(const auto & cell : tria.active_cell_iterators())
  for(unsigned int f = 0; f < cell->n_faces(); ++f)
    (void) cell->face(f);
\end{c++}
Alternatively, one can use an iterator-based approach to loop over all faces
of a cell, introduced in the last release. The relevant functions have been adjusted to be able to deal with
various number of faces. 
\begin{c++}
for(const auto & cell : tria.active_cell_iterators())
  for(const auto & face : cell->face_iterators())
    (void) face;
\end{c++}
Furthermore, the number of degrees of freedom might differ between cells so that
local data storage units needed for assembly might need to be resized for each 
cell as it is already good practice in the hp context:
\begin{c++}
std::vector<double> local_rhs;
for(const auto & cell : tria.active_cell_iterators())
 {
   hp_fe_values.reinit(cell);
   local_rhs.resize(hp_fe_values.get_present_fe_values().n_dofs_per_cell());
 }
\end{c++}


What is true for cells is also true for faces in 3D: faces can be either triangles
or quadrilaterals. This is the case even if no mixed mesh is used. As a consequence, some functions, e.g. \texttt{FiniteElementData::n\_dofs\_per\_face()}, have been extended with a new optional argument for the face number.

We tried---where possible---to provide utility functions so that users do not need to access a \texttt{GeometryInfo}-like data structure. However, these functions internally rely on the \texttt{ReferenceCell::\allowbreak internal::\allowbreak Info} classes, which are similarly structured as \texttt{GeometryInfo} and even use it for hypercube cells. Users can query the reference-cell type of geometric entity via:
\begin{c++}
const auto reference_cell_type = cell->reference_cell_type();
\end{c++}
and can access the relevant struct describing the current reference cell or its i-th face via:
\begin{c++}
ReferenceCell::internal::Info::get_cell(reference_cell_type);
ReferenceCell::internal::Info::get_face(reference_cell_type, i);
\end{c++}


Furthermore, it is crucial to use the right FE--mapping--quadrature family 
for the right cell type. In particular, this means that users cannot 
rely on default parameters regarding mapping and/or quadrature in the 
context of simplex meshes since these are defined for hypercube cells.
We recommend to choose the needed mapping,
FE, and quadrature rules at a single central place and pass these throughout the program
in the form of ``scratch data''.

\subsubsection{Matrix-free support}

We provide matrix-free support for simplex and mixed meshes as well as for
continuous and discontinuous elements. From the user perspective, the setup has
hardly changed:
%\begin{c++}
%Simplex::QGauss<dim> quad(degree + 1)
%
%MatrixFree matrix_free;
%matrix_free.reinit(mapping, dof_handler, constraints, quad);
%\end{c++}
Instead of providing a 1D quadrature rule, which is extended to higher dimensional
spaces via a tensor product, one provides d-dimensional quadrature rules.
The templated versions of \texttt{FEEvaluation} and \texttt{FEFaceEvaluation} cannot be used: the number of degrees of freedom and the number of quadrature points are determined at runtime. More details can be found in Subsection~\ref{subsec:mf}.

By the time of writing, we do not use internally any advance techniques for evaluating values and 
gradients at the quadrature points as we do for tensor-product elements and 
instead rely on full interpolation matrices. This is for now acceptable since only low-order elements are 
supported.

\subsection{Advances in the multigrid infrastructure}
\label{subsec:mg}

Until now, \dealii has only supported local smoothing multigrid algorithms~\citep{ClevengerHeisterKanschatKronbichler2019}. With release 9.3, the support for global coarsening of continuous (\texttt{FE\_Q}) and discontinuous (\texttt{FE\_DGQ}) elements  in a geometric and a polynomial sense has been added. These multigrid variants promise less iteration numbers and better parallel scalability with the disadvantage of having to deal with hanging nodes during smoothing and of more work per iteration overall.

Global-coarsening algorithms~\citep{becker00} either coarsen each cell of a triangulation or reduce the polynomial degree of the finite element of each cell and hereby obtain a new system with less unknowns (also known as "coarse level"). 
Repeating such kind of coarsening results in a sequence of multigrid levels.

The transfer between two levels has been encoded in the new class \texttt{MGTwoLevelTransfer}, which can be set up via the functions \texttt{MGTwoLevelTransfer::\allowbreak reinit\_\allowbreak geometric\_\allowbreak transfer()} or \texttt{MGTwo\allowbreak LevelTransfer::\allowbreak reinit\_\allowbreak polynomial\_\allowbreak transfer()} for given
\texttt{DoFHandler} and \texttt{AffineConstraint} classes of two levels. The resulting transfer operators
between two levels can be collected in a single object 
(\texttt{MGTransferGlobalCoarsening}) that can be used just as \texttt{MGTransferMatrixFree} and can be passed to the actual \texttt{Multigrid}
algorithm. The option that users can set up the transfer operators between two levels on their own enables
the mix of polynomial  and geometric coarsening, as needed. It should also be noted that a transfer between continuous
and discontinuous elements is possible by providing \texttt{DoFHandler}s set up with this kind of elements.

Internally, the transfer operators categorize fine/coarse cell pairs according to the 
occurrence of refinement 
(refinement or no-refinement) and to the polynomial-degree pair ($k_f$-$k_c$) into groups. 
The projection and restriction are performed with efficient matrix-free kernels applying
1D projection and restriction matrices.


The user is responsible for setting up the levels (including the operators and the
smoothers). Please note that global coarsening can currently only be performed between active levels. 
The user can apply utility
functions from the \texttt{MGTransferGlobalCoarseningTools} namespace to set up the levels. For 
constructing the diagonal or the system matrix for a matrix-free operator,
needed for the smoother or the coarse-grid solver,
the functions \texttt{create\_diagonal()} and \texttt{create\_matrix()} from
the \texttt{MatrixFreeTools} namespace can be used (see also Subsection~\ref{subsec:mf}).


The usage of the new transfer operators (and of some of the utility functions) in the context of a hybrid multigrid algorithm (hp-MG with AMG as coarse-grid solver) for hp problems is demonstrated in the new tutorial \texttt{step-75} (see also Subsection~\ref{subsec:steps}).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advances in the matrix-free infrastructure}
\label{subsec:mf}

\subsubsection{Precompilation of evaluation kernels}

The classes \texttt{FEEvaluation} and \texttt{FEFaceEvaluation} are highly
templated to reach high performance. In particular, the template parameters include
the polynomial degree of the finite element $k$ and the number of the 1D quadrature points $q$.
For applications codes that rely on operators of many different degrees (e.g., because
they use p-multigrid or hp algorithms), the instantiation
means a long compilation time. 

In the current release, we have improved the \texttt{FEEvaluation} and the \texttt{FEFaceEvaluation} class implementations, which do
not rely on the template parameters $k$ and $q$ (expressed in the code
with "-1" and "0"):
\begin{c++}
FEEvaluation<dim, -1, 0, n_components, Number, VectorizedArrayType>
  phi(range, dofhandler_index, quadrature_index, first_selected_component);
\end{c++}
The meaning of the new first argument is 
discussed in Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsection:mf:hp}.

These classes select at runtime---for common low and medium polynomial degree/quadrature combinations ($k\le 6$ and $q\in\{ k+1, k+2, \lfloor (3k)/2 \rfloor \}$)---efficient precompiled implementations and default to non-templated 
evaluation kernels else. 

In the case that even higher polynomial degrees are needed, one can precompile the
relevant internal classes
(\texttt{FEEvaluationFactory}, \texttt{FEFaceEvaluationFactory}, \texttt{CellwiseInverseMassFactory}) in the user code for needed \texttt{degree}s
and \texttt{VectorizedArrayType}s in the following way:
\begin{c++}
#define FE_EVAL_FACTORY_DEGREE_MAX 12

#include <deal.II/matrix_free/evaluation_template_factory.templates.h>

DEAL_II_NAMESPACE_OPEN
template struct dealii::internal::FEEvaluationFactory
  <dim, VectorizedArrayType::value_type, VectorizedArrayType>;  
DEAL_II_NAMESPACE_CLOSE
\end{c++}

\subsubsection{Parallel matrix-free hp implementation}\label{subsubsection:mf:hp}

With release 9.1, large parts of the hp algorithms in \dealii were parallelized so that
parallel matrix-based simulations can be performed with the hp infrastructure. In the present
release, we have extended the setup routines of \texttt{MatrixFree} so that it now also
provides parallel hp support.

Until now, the \texttt{FEEvaluation} classes used the template parameters $k$ and $q$ to select the correct active hp FE and quadrature index and users had 
to use the function \texttt{MatrixFree::create\_cell\_\allowbreak subrange\_\allowbreak hp()} or
\texttt{::create\_cell\_\allowbreak subrange\_\allowbreak hp\_\allowbreak by\_index()} to create subranges of cells with 
the same polynomial degree. This led to user codes that were hard to read due to complicated jump tables. 

The creation of subranges is now performed internally, and the non-templated versions
of the \texttt{FEEvaluation} classes are extended for the hp case. To nevertheless determine
the active hp FE and quadrature index, the current cell/face range has to be provided
the constructors of the \texttt{FEEvaluation} classes, from which the relevant information
can be deduced (in the simplex case also the face type). These changes enable
users to write matrix-free code independently of whether hp is used or not.

The new tutorial \texttt{step-75} presents how to use the new hp-related features in \texttt{MatrixFree} 
in the context of a hybrid-multigrid solver.

\subsubsection{MPI-3.0 shared-memory support} 
The classes \texttt{MatrixFree} and \texttt{LinearAlgebra::\allowbreak distributed::\allowbreak Vector} have been extended with 
MPI-3.0 shared-memory features. If \texttt{MatrixFree} has been configured by setting
\texttt{MatrixFree::AdditionalData::communicator\_sm} by an appropriate user-provided subcommunicator,
vectors are created by \texttt{MatrixFree::create\_dof\_vector()} in such a way that the
memory of processes in this subcommunicator can be accessed. In particular, this means 
that the \texttt{FEEvaluation} classes can access the degrees of freedom owned by 
other processes and in certain cases local 
communication can be skipped. To prevent race conditions, \texttt{MatrixFree} uses local
barriers at the beginning and the end of loops (\texttt{loop()}, \texttt{cell\_loop()}, \texttt{loop\_cell\_centric()}).

The novel tutorial \texttt{step-67b} shows the usage of the new MPI-3.0 feature
 in the context of the solution
of the Euler equations. Here, a speed-up of 27\% could be reached compared to the
regular version \texttt{step-67}, by using the new feature.
For more details and a successful application in the library \texttt{hyper.deal}, see \citep{munch2020hyperdeal}.

\subsubsection{Miscellaneous}

The namespace \texttt{MatrixFreeTools} has been introduced. It collects various utility
functions useful in the context of application of \texttt{MatrixFree}. In particular,
it contains different functions to extract quantities related to a matrix, e.g., the 
computation of the diagonal or a matrix with a matrix-free approach.

With version 9.2, we have introduced cell-centric loops. They have been extended to unstructured
meshes. The tutorial \texttt{step-67b} shows their usage in the context of the solution
of the Euler equations.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{New and improved tutorials and code gallery programs}
\label{subsec:steps}

Many of the \dealii{} tutorial programs were revised in a variety of
ways as part of this release. A particular example is that we have
converted a number of programs to use range-based for loops (a C++11
feature) for loops over a range of integer indices such as loops over
all quadrature points or all indices of degrees of freedom during
assembly. This makes sense given that the
range-based way of writing loops seems to be the idiomatic approach
these days, and that we had previously already converted loops over
all cells in this way.

In addition, there are a number of new tutorial programs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{step-19} TODO
\item \texttt{step-67b} is an explicit time integrator for the
        compressible Euler equations discretized with a high-order discontinuous
        Galerkin (DG) scheme, using the matrix-free infrastructure just as \texttt{step67} does.
        The tutorial presents advanced topics, like the usage of cell-centric loops and
        the new MPI-3.0 shared-memory capabilities of \texttt{MatrixFree} tor each high
        throughput. Furthermore, the utilization of the template parameter
        \texttt{VectorizedArrayType} and the application of lambdas to capture cell and face
        integrals are discussed.
\item \texttt{step-68} TODO
\item \texttt{step-75} TODO
\end{itemize}

There are also new programs in the code gallery (a collection of
user-contributed programs that often solve more complicated problems
than tutorial programs, and intended as starting points for further
research rather than as teaching tools):
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
\end{itemize}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Incompatible changes}

The 9.3 release includes
\href{https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_9_1_1_and_9_2_0.html}
{around 60 incompatible changes}; see \cite{changes92}. The majority of these changes
should not be visible to typical user codes; some remove previously
deprecated classes and functions; and the majority change internal
interfaces that are not usually used in external
applications. That said, the following are worth mentioning since they
may have been more widely used:
